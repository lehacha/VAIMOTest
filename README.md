# VAIMOTest
PHP. Script for elevator. No visualization. Using OOP principles.
I created 4 classes(Person, Elevator_Interface, Elevator, Engine) and 1 abstruct class(Move).
Elevator_Interface is a bridge between Person and Elevator. Abstract class Move is functionality of class Engine(which is used by Elevator to move up and down).
